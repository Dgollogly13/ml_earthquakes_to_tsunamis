# Classifying Art Styles with Machine Learning

Our team sought to analyze the effectiveness of three machine learning libraries for image classification. Our goal was to compare the differences in classification accuracy among the three models we created, as well as a pre-trained model called “MobileNetv2”. The images used in the classification were art datasets from five distinct styles, or genres, of artwork.
