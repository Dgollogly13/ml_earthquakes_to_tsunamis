# Classifying Art Styles with Machine Learning

The goal of this challenge was to build three machine learning models that would classify an art image into ..... distinct categories. 

## Getting Started 

We are running this code with the open-source platform Jupyter Notebook. In order to run this code on your machine you will need an equivalent application and the proper dependencies installed.
